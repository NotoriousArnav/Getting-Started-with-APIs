# Getting Started with APIs
## Part 2 Usage
Now, We will use some APIs for little bit for Python scripting.If you are not familiar with Python, you can use your language of Choice.

In this Article we will use HTTP APIs.

### NASA APIs
You can Visit [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov) for the APIs they Have a ton of Free APIs.
As Shown in a Previous Example for [1.md](./1.md) we will be NASA APOD API.

We will be Making a Python Script that Downloads daily Astronomical Picture Given by NASA.
Source Code is Available at [NASA_APOD.py](./NASA_APOD.py)

```Python
import requests

URL="https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY" 
```

Here we are Using the requests module in Python to make requests to a Specified URL we Specify.

```Python

data = reqquests.get(URL)
data_dict = data.json()
print(data_dict)
```
This way we Got the Response from the API and then parse in Python's Dictionary Format.
Now as we remember from [1.md](./1.md), they have a Key named "hdurl" which contains the HD Picture URL.
We need to Download That Picture from the Given URL and Save it as "{date Today}_NASA-APOD.jpg"

```Python

hdurl = data_dict['hdurl']
hdpicture = requests.get(hdurl)
with open(f"{data_dict['date']}_NASA-APOD.jpg", 'wb') as f:
  f.write(hdpicture.content)

```

Here we Extracted the URL, and downloaded the Picture. To Save it we Used here the with statement to  Automatically Close the file after Writing.

And here we have it!
