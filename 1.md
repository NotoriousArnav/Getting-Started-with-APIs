# Getting Started with API Usage and development
APIs are an Integral part of the Modern Internet.
From the Weather app to the Spotify's Scrolling Lyrics, everything we see on the Internet is backed by API(s).

## What is an API?
An API Stands for Application Programming Interface.
It allows two Different programs to talk to each other, just like we humans talk to each other to get our work done.
There are various Types of APIs but it isn't significant enough to learn about them.

## How do they work?

APIs are just like websites, that work when you load them.
So when you load a website, beautiful Browser Compatible Code is loaded to make it User-Friendly.
Same is with APIs, except they don't show up  User-friendly Data on Browser, instead they load up something that can be used by another programs, because most of the times they just send Required Data asked by the program/user.

Explanation For a Lay man here,

Let us Imagine, we are in a Hypothetical Diner.
In a Diner we Have:
1. The Customer, who is Hungry
2. The Chef who is going to Feed us
3. The waiter who is going to take orders and Bring Food to us.
Here the Waiter is Working like an API. We Get the Required Data, and we only post the required Information to the Chef.

```
GET https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY
```
<br>
This will result in:

```json

  "explanation": "At opposition, opposite the Sun in Earth's sky, late last month Jupiter is also approaching perihelion, the closest point to the Sun in its elliptical orbit, early next year. That makes Jupiter exceptionally close to our fair planet, currently resulting in excellent views of the Solar System's ruling gas giant. On September 27, this sharp image of Jupiter was recorded with a small telescope from a backyard in Florence, Arizona. The stacked video frames reveal the massive world bounded by planet girdling winds. Dark belts and light zones span the gas giant, along with rotating oval storms and its signature Great Red Spot. Galilean moon Ganymede is below and right in the frame. The Solar System's largest moon and its shadow are in transit across the southern Jovian cloud tops.",

The above data maybe readable to many users, since it is JSON.
Here we have requested [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov) to send their lates APOD, Astronomical Picture of the day and its Description.
Now this data, can be used in a Program in development and make Some great Application.

The Best Example is a Arbitary Weather app that we Use everyday in Our Smart-phones and the One That is embeded in Windows 10/11 Taskbar.
They all send a GET request to their Servers with the Area Data like City, Town, Coordinates to get the Weather Data back to the app and Show that in a Nice Way.

## If APIs are Useful, don't people Exploit it?
Yes, People Do exploit APIs!
If You know about WebScraping (the Process extracting Usefull data from HTML), You know its tedious and Often Breaks.
A API makes this Job Easier, by providing Easily Parsable Data.
To make sure they Aren't Exploited, API Devs use Authentication and Authorization on their APIs.

Now, Here comes a Confusing part! Many People Get Confused between Authentication and Authorization.
<table>
<tr>
	<th>Authentication</th>
	<th>Authorization</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Authentication is the Process of Filtering Valid User Requests from Fraud Users</td>
	<td>Authorization is the Process by which the User's Permissions for a Certian action are checked</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Example: Authentication allows only users who signed up for the API service to use the API</td>
	<td>Example: Authorization will allow/disallow the given user to access a particular API endpoint.</td>
</tr>
</table>

As You have seen in the Previous Example, we had to supply a `api_key` in the URL, to make sure the server know that we are allowed to use the API and access the Endpoint `/planetary/apod`

Many APIs have their own way to Authenticate their Users. Some use Authorization Token Headers, but many use the `API_KEY` in their URL.

Many APIs Are also Free to use and don't require you to sign up.
